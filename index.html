      <p style="color:white;">
        Kobe Bryant was on fire for his final NBA game, giving the Los Angeles
        Lakers one more amazing show of offence to close out his 20-year career.
        Scoring 60 points out off 50 shots Bryant brought his playing career to
        an end on Wednesday night with the Lakers beating the Utah Jazz 101-96.
        It was a storybook finish, the sixth 60-point game of his career. It
        also was the most shots taken by anyone in an NBA game in the past 30
        seasons. He retires as the NBA's third-highest all-time scorer and won
        five championships.
